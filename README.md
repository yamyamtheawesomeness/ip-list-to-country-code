ip-list-to-country-code
=======================

This script converts IP adresses from a list into country Code


The propose for the script is a list of IP adresses you want to check for the country without any whois/reverse DNS or other stuff where you need 
to access a remote Server and get banned (like me) for having to many requests open.


The script operates with Maxminds Open Source Country List


It has been designed to run on any shared host without any aditional installations (except PHP of course)
As it has been used to check around 200.000 IP's the script has been trimmed to performance and stability.


How to:

Copy the whole data source to a host of your choice and fill the ip.csv file with IP's

One line is one IP

When you run the script you will get the output to your browser ( you may wanna redirect it into a file)


Have fun
